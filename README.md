# portfolio-difference-find
Python script I wrote to help a friend find the difference between the companies listed in an earlier and a later stock portfolio Excel spreadsheet. Takes two command-line arguments--the path of the earlier portfolio's file and the path of the second's. Uses pandas and numpy for processing excel sheet and applying difference-finding method to arrays respectively.
To run:
```
python3 differencefind.py {first portfolio's file path} {second portfolio's file path}
```
