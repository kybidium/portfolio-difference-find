# portfolio-difference-find
Python script I wrote to help a friend find the difference between the companies invested in in an earlier and a later stock portfolio excel sheet. Takes two command-line arguments--the path of the earlier portfolio's file and the path of the second's. Uses pandas and numpy for processing excel sheet and applying difference-finding method to arrays respectively.
